Steps to create a server from scratch 

1. Choose a hosting service website.
2. Register an account on the website.
3. Purchase a virtual private server.
4. Use the credentials received by email to access 
the VPS from a linux terminal with the ssh command 
(example: ssh ubuntu@155.28.637.373)
5. Change the password to something personal/easier using "passwd" command.
6. For additional security you can create SSH keys in the local server 
using the following command ("ssh-keygen -b 4096").
7. Once the keys are created, copy the public key into the VPS' .ssh folder.
8. Update packages and install nginx using "apt-get install nginx".
9. Verify service status with "systemctl" command.
10. Test server by typing in the ip address location in a browser search engine.
(Remember that files should go in the /var/www/html/ folder)
