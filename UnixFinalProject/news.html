					<p>Can't manage to get your hands on the new Playstation 5? We might know why.. As you have probably noticed by now, despite having released many consoles, Playstation is facing the consequences of a global chip shortage. What's worse is the fact that the lack of semiconductors is occuring around the world which means that Playstation isn't the only one having difficulties. Indeed, car manufacturers and phone manufacturers who also use semiconductors have been told that the shortage could last for months or even years. Moreover, with console scalpers buying up all the PS5 stock, buying a console during the limited restocks won't happen any time soon. Unfortunately, what this means for gamers is that they will have to wait or purchase the console at a higher price.</p>
